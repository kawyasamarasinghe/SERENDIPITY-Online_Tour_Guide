                Sprawling across half of South America, Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world. White-sand beaches, tropical islands, music-filled metropolises and charming colonial towns are dotting its 7,500 km (4,600 mi) long coastline. Inland, Brazil tourist
                attractions consist of imposing waterfalls, wetlands filled with wildlife, and the untouched wilderness of the Amazon rainforest where several isolated tribes still live without any contact with the rest of the world. Brazil, the largest
                country in Latin America, became a Portuguese colony in 1500, remaining under Portuguese rule for 300 years. Remnants of this heritage can be seen throughout historic colonial cities even today. Brazil also has gorgeous beaches, famed
                for their surfing waves and scenic beauty. Great beaches can be found in the Rio area, while others may be so isolated getting there is an adventure in itself. Here’s a look at the top tourist attractions in Brazil:

                <p>
                    Located in Rio, Copacabana is one of the world’s most well-known beaches. It is approximately two miles long and lined with hotels and expensive homes, though there are also much more modest residences scattered in between. A beautiful boardwalk with
                    a black-and-white checked pattern of Portuguese stone flanks the sand. This is a very vibrant neighborhood that is home to Rio’s famous New Year’s celebration and several interesting attractions, including the Copacabana Fort, which
                    was constructed in 1914, and the glamorous Hotel Copacabana Palace.

                <p>
                    There are carnival celebrations in virtually every corner of Brazil, the best-known ones taking place in Recife together with the neighboring Olinda and Salvador. But the biggest and most famous carnival is undoubtedly the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro.
                    The Rio Carnival attracts two million people per day on the streets and almost half a million foreigners during its 4 day celebration. The Carnival is all over the place, in the streets and squares, bars, clubs and all other venues
                    in Rio, concluding in the spectacular Rio Samba Parade at the Sambadrome.

                <p>
                    For ecotourists, Bonito is the jumping off point for some of the most unique natural attractions in Brazil, including stunning waterfalls and caves. However, its most popular draw is its extremely clear waterways, where you can swim with fish. And for
                    the most adventurous, there is Abismo Anhumas, where visitors can rappel to the bottom of a cavern and walk among stalagmites and other cave formations. Visitors can also choose to snorkel or even dive in the cavern’s waters, which
                    contain even more otherworldly formations.

                <p>
                    One of Brazil’s booming beach destinations, Porto de Galinhas attracts hordes of tourists during holiday times. So what makes Porto de Galinhas so special? For starters, it boasts pretty white sand beaches, beautiful weather, warm waters, and a nice selection
                    of accommodations in all price ranges. But what truly sets Porto de Galinhas apart is the stunning natural pools that form in the reefs at low tide where visitors can swim with large schools of colorful fish.

                <p>
                    The Pantanal is the world’s largest wetland, lying mostly in Western Brazil but extending into Bolivia and Paraguay as well. Famous for its wildlife, it is one of Brazil’s major tourist attractions. Unlike the Amazon rainforest, in the Pantanal you are
                    virtually guaranteed to actually see the wildlife. Capybara and the Yacare Caiman are present in the millions. The Pantanal is also home to one of the largest Jaguar populations in the Americas.

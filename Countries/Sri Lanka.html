                <p>
                    Nine Arch Bridge is also called the Bridge in the sky and is among the iconic Sri Lanka tourism places. It is in the small mountain town of Ella and offers visitors with splendid view of the surrounding area which comprises of lush greenery and tea fields.
                    What makes the bridge unique is that it is made up of stone, brick and cement. There is no use of any steel. It is one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka for a memorable holiday.

            <div class="desc ">
                <p>
                    Missing Yala National Park while Sri Lanka sightseeing might bring regret to wildlife lovers. It is home to a host of wildlife and birds you are bound to run into a group of elephants bathing in streams, tossing their trunks wildly or leopards nestling
                    lazily on tree branches. You could opt for the safari drives or a nature trail among the thick green foliage of the forest. Some tourists also camp at Yala and enjoy a barbeque under the stars. With so much to see and do here, Yala
                    is indeed one of the best tourist places in Sri Lanka. Yala is the perfect place to try your hand at wildlife photography. Getting to Yala National Park is quite simple. All you will have to do is drive down to the Park from Colombo.
                    Another way is by taking a bus to Tissamaharama.

                <p>
                    Sigiriya or the mount of remembrance is a World Heritage Site and one of the most stunning places to see in Sri Lanka. This giant formation of rock rises out of nowhere towering over everything in its vicinity. It is quite a climb to the top but once
                    up there you will get to see a panoramic view of the nearby sights and the Sigiriya fort. The rock fortress is a slice of history perched on a rock and is really worth a visit. Not much is heard and said about Polonnaruwa, but this
                    ancient city is no less than the Petra of the south. A gem among Sri Lanka tourist attractions, this ancient ruined city stands amidst its erstwhile sturdy columns and architecture. The best way to explore this ancient city is to hire
                    a bike and zoom around the ruins. The site is well maintained and is a telling example of Sri Lankas history and culture. Polonnaruwa can be easily accessed via Sigiriya. You can take a tuk-tuk or a bus from Sigiriya. Or you can take
                    a bus from Dambulla to Polonnaruwa.

                <p>
                    Unawatuna traces its roots to the great epic Ramayana. In the epic, the monkey-warrior Hanuman was sent back to India to fetch the four medicinal herbs by Jambavan namely, mritasanjeevani, vishalyakarani, suvarnakarani, and sandhani from the Himalayas
                    in order to heal Lakshman who was wounded trying to save the abducted Princess Sita from the demon king Ravana. Hanuman failed to identify these herbs, so he lifted the entire mountain and carried it to the battlefield to try to save
                    Lakshman, but in the process, a chunk of it "fell-down" in the location of the present day Unawatuna, the name of the village derives from "Una-watuna" meaning "fell down". Currently, an edifice is being built in honour of Hanuman
                    on the harbour end of Rumassala Hill by Japanese monks of the Mahayana sect of Buddhism near the Peace Pagoda that they built.

                    The beautiful Ravana falls is one of the famous Sri Lanka attractions. The majestic and magnificent fall is an impressive sight especially during the rainy season. Located on the main road to Ella, it is a common stop for the visitors during their journey.
                    During the hot summer months, the falls are used for bathing. It is among the most stunning waterfalls in Sri Lanka.
